Sierpinski
======

## About
Hi my name is [Fabrice Rasoamiaramanana](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/frasoamiaramanana) and here is a Theme I have developped for [Dropplets](http://dropplets.com). I named this theme after [Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wac%C5%82aw_Sierpi%C5%84ski) a great polish mathematician that I discovered many years ago while working on Fractals at the university. Fractals are amazing, fractals are beautiful and I hope that you will say the same about my `Sierpinski` theme. 

##Installation
Just copy the `Sierpinski` folder into your `templates` folder, then select it from the list of installed templates in your dropplets menu.

Additionnaly, the `index.php` at the `dropplets` root folder must be replaced by the one provided here
